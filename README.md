General purpose fully-connected MLP in theano

The functions required to create the MLP are provided in nnetFunc.py. One example of training using cross validation for a multi-output network is given in trainNNetXval.py. This last file can be modified to change the parameters of the model (number of hidden units, hidden layers, regularisation, learning rate,...)
