General purpose fully-connected MLP in theano

The functions required to create the MLP are provided in nnetFunc.py. One example of training using cross validation for a multi-output network is given in trainNNetXval.py. This last file can be modified to change the parameters of the model (number of hidden units, hidden layers, regularisation, learning rate,...)

All the functions contained in this repository were developed in the Multiscale Cardiovascular Engineering Group at University College London (MUSE-UCL) by Carlos Ledezma.
